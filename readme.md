== Description ==

Nicho makes it easy to deliver a seamless brand experience on any website to drive engagement and purchases with a single line of code. Our self-service platform enables brands to deliver the right social content at the right time, and control the experience from end-to-end on any device.

== Installation ==

First way: transfer the entire nicho directory to the /wp-content/plugins/

The second: is to “zip” the nicho directory and upload it to your system using the WordPress admin panel:

Login to the administration panel /wp-admin/.
From the dashboard navigation, click Plugins.
Click Add New.
From the tabbed items, click Upload.
Regardless of how the file is uploaded to the server, once the plugin script has been transferred to WordPress it must be activated before it will run. To do this:

Login to the administration panel /wp-admin/.
From the dashboard navigation, click Plugins.
Find Udemy Test Plugin (or whatever you called your plugin) in the list and click Activate.

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `<?php do_action('plugin_name_hook'); ?>` in your templates

directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` 
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
